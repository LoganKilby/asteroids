Working version of my asteroid game

This game is still in development.
There is a release available if you'd like to download the game and try it. There are a few issues, but the game is playable from start to finish.

# Compiling (.bat file)
Dependencies:
* GLFW
* GLEW
* GLM
* OpenGL
* FreeType

All dependencies are included if you would like to compile the source code. Compiling will require you to alter the
file paths associated with the freetype_include, glfw_lib, and freetype_lib variables in the build.bat file.
