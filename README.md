My recreation of the classic Asteroids game

There is a release available if you'd like to download the game and try it.

# Gameplay
* Movement: W key to boost forward, A and D keys to turn left or right
* Shoot: Spacebar

# Compiling (.bat file)
Dependencies:
* GLFW
* GLEW
* GLM
* OpenGL
* FreeType

All dependencies are included if you would like to compile the source code. Compiling will require you to alter the
file paths associated with the freetype_include, glfw_lib, and freetype_lib variables in the build.bat file.
