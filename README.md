# asteroids
Working version of my asteroid game

The game is still in development.
I have no intentions of using this repository as an up-to-date reference of the game's progress, although I may re-archive it in the future.
I am archiving it here incase my computer blows up, or the source code is otherwise lost!

# Compiling (.bat file)
Dependencies:
* GLFW
* GLEW
* GLM
* FreeType

All dependencies are included in the source. Compiling will require you to alter the
file path of the freetype_include, glfw_lib, and freetype_lib variables in the build.bat file.
